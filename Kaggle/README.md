# Kaggle Competition - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
## Model Fitting on the Ames, Iowa Dataset

The Kaggle competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

### What I did

1. Because this is a learning set, I practiced fitting the following models with default settings to the dataset:
   - Ridge Regression 
   - Lasso Regression
   - KNN
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machines

2. I used a cross-validated grid search to refine my models and then prepared a learning curve for each attribute.

3. I used the top performing model on the test set and submitted my results on Kaggle.
